After downloading and extracting the partra directory, go to the directory and type the command:
make

This will compile the source code and make a static library called partra.a inside the directory. 

To use partra, make sure that the header files are all in the same directory as your C/C++ source code. At the top of your code, include the following line:
#include "partra.h"

To compile with partra, type the following for C:
gcc source.c -o output -lpartra -L[partradir]
where [partradir] is the directory where the partra static library partra.a is located. If in the same directory, use:
gcc source.c -o output -lpartra -L.

For C++, substitute g++ for gcc.
