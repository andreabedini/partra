After downloading and extracting the partra directory, go to the directory and type the command:
make

This will compile the source code, make a static library called partra.a inside the directory, and make the stand alone program called partra.

To use the partra library, make sure that the header files are all in the same directory as your C/C++ source code. At the top of your code, include the following line:
#include "partra.h"

To compile with partra, type the following for C:
gcc source.c -o output -lpartra -L[partradir]
where [partradir] is the directory where the partra static library partra.a is located. If in the same directory, use:
gcc source.c -o output -lpartra -L.

For C++, substitute g++ for gcc.


To use the partra stand alone program, go to its directory and type:
./partra
to answer command line questions about which file to generate. 

To use an input file, type:
./partra [inputfile]
A sample input file with instructions is provided, called partra_input.txt:
./partra partra_input.txt
