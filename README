After downloading and extracting the partra directory, go to the directory and type the command:
make

This will compile the source code, make a static library called partra.a inside the directory, and make the stand-alone program called partra.

To include the partra library, make sure that the header files are all in the same directory as your C/C++ source code. At the top of your code, include the following line:
#include "partra.h"

The use of the functions in the partra library are described in the pdf file partra_user_guide.pdf.

To compile with partra, type the following for C:
gcc source.c -o output -lpartra -L[partradir]
where [partradir] is the directory where the partra static library partra.a is located. If in the same directory, use:
gcc source.c -o output -lpartra -L.

For C++, substitute g++ for gcc.


partra currently conforms strictly to the ANSI C standard C11, and so the source code can be compiled with any C11 compliant compiler. In the future, non-ANSI C partra functions will all be collected under a different header file than the ANSI conforming source code. 



To use the partra stand-alone program, go to its directory and type:
./partra
to answer command line questions about which file to generate. 

To use an input file for the stand-alone program, type:
./partra [inputfile]
A sample input file with instructions is provided, called partra_input.txt:
./partra partra_input.txt
