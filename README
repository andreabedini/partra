ANSI C11 conforming:
partra currently strictly conforms to the ANSI C standard C11, and so the source code can be compiled with any C11 compliant compiler. In the future, non-ANSI C partra functions will all be collected under a different header file than the ANSI conforming source code. 

Installing in Unix:
After downloading and extracting the partra directory, go to the directory and type the command:
make
This will compile the source code, make a static library called partra.a inside the directory, and make the stand-alone program called partra.


Installing in other OS's:
1. Use an ANSI C11 compliant compiler to compile all of the .c source files (except for partra.c) as .o object files
2. Create a static library from the all the .o object files
3. Compile partra.c, linking to the new static library created


Use of partra in your C/C++ source code:
To include the partra library, make sure that the header files are all in the same directory as your C/C++ source code. At the top of your code, include the following line:
#include "partra.h"
The use of the functions in the partra library are described in the pdf file partra_user_guide.pdf.


Compiling your source code with partra in Unix:
To compile with partra, type the following for C:
gcc source.c -o output -lpartra -L[partradir]
where [partradir] is the directory where the partra static library partra.a is located. If in the same directory, use:
gcc source.c -o output -lpartra -L.
For C++, substitute g++ for gcc.


Compiling your source code with partra in other OS's:
1. compile your source code while linking to the static library you created. 


Use of the stand-alone program in Unix:
Go to its directory and type:
./partra
to answer command line questions about which file to generate. 
To use an input file for the stand-alone program, type:
./partra [inputfile]
A sample input file with instructions is provided, called partra_input.txt:
./partra partra_input.txt


Use of the stand-alone program in other OS's:
Go to its directory on a command line and type:
[partra executible]
to answer command line questions about which file to generate. To use an input file for the stand-alone program, type:
[partra executible] [input file]
A sample input file with instructions is provided, called partra_input.txt:
[partra executible] partra_input.txt
